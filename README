These are my solutions for the Advent Of Code 2021 challenge. Most of them are unpolished and are very inefficient. 
However, my goal was just to be able to solve each problem in a day, regardless of efficiency or elegance of the solution.
I plan to comer over them later and improve them to make them more efficient.
